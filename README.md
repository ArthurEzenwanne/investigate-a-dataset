## Investigate a Dataset Project

In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## What did I learn?
After completing the project, I learnt:
1. All the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
2. Have familiarity in posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
3. How to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use for analysis
4. How to communicating the results of my analysis and why it is necessary to initiate such communication with my Team
5. How to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
6. How to efficiently work with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which helped me access data more conveniently
7. How to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce plots showing my findings

## The Anlysis Process
1. Step One - Choose a Data Set
2. Step Two - Get Organized
3. Step Three - Analyze Data
4. Step Four - Share Findings

This project is part of the series executed in my Udacity Data Analyst program
